### React Native
React Native is Facebook's framework for building mobile applications using React and JavaScript. It allows developers to create truly native apps with the familiarity of React development patterns.

**Key Advantages:**
- Familiar React development experience
- Large JavaScript ecosystem
- Good community support
- Code sharing between iOS and Android
- Over-the-air updates capability

## State Management Best Practices 2024

### Flutter State Management

#### BLoC/Cubit - Production Ready (Recommended for Enterprise)
**When to Use:**
- Large, complex applications
- Enterprise-level projects
- When you need predictable state management
- Projects requiring extensive testing
- Teams that benefit from strict patterns

**Best Practices:**
- Use Cubit for simpler state scenarios
- Use BLoC for complex event-driven logic
- Implement clean architecture layers
- Use dependency injection with GetIt
- Follow the repository pattern

**Key Dependencies:**
```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_bloc: ^8.1.3
  equatable: ^2.0.5
  get_it: ^7.6.4
  injectable: ^2.3.0
```

#### Riverpod - Modern Alternative (Recommended for New Projects)
**When to Use:**
- Medium to large applications
- When you want compile-time safety
- Projects requiring flexible dependency injection
- Modern Flutter applications

**Best Practices:**
- Use StateProvider for simple state
- Use StateNotifierProvider for complex state
- Leverage AsyncValue for handling loading/error states
- Use family modifiers for parameterized providers

#### GetX - Rapid Development (Recommended for MVPs)
**When to Use:**
- Small to medium applications
- Rapid prototyping
- When simplicity is preferred
- Projects with tight deadlines

**Best Practices:**
- Use GetBuilder for performance-critical widgets
- Implement clean architecture with GetX
- Use GetX dependency injection
- Follow reactive programming patterns

#### Provider - Beginner Friendly
**When to Use:**
- Learning Flutter
- Simple applications
- When you want to understand state management fundamentals

### React Native State Management

#### Redux Toolkit - Enterprise Standard
**When to Use:**
- Large, complex applications
- When you need time-travel debugging
- Projects with complex state interactions
- Teams familiar with Redux patterns

**Best Practices:**
- Use RTK Query for data fetching
- Implement normalized state structure
- Use createSlice for reducers
- Follow the ducks pattern for organization

#### Zustand - Lightweight Alternative
**When to Use:**
- Small to medium applications
- When Redux feels too heavy
- Projects requiring dynamic state updates
- Performance-critical applications

**Best Practices:**
- Use immer for immutable updates
- Implement middleware for persistence
- Create separate stores for different domains
- Use subscribeWithSelector for optimizations

#### Context API - Built-in Solution
**When to Use:**
- Simple global state needs
- Theme or language preferences
- Authentication state
- Small applications

**Best Practices:**
- Avoid frequent updates to prevent re-renders
- Split contexts by concern
- Use React.memo to optimize components
- Combine with useReducer for complex state

## Clean Architecture Patterns

### Flutter Clean Architecture

#### Layer Structure
```
lib/
├── core/              # Infrastructure & shared utilities
├── data/              # Data layer (repositories impl, datasources, models)
├── domain/            # Business logic (entities, repository interfaces)
└── presentation/      # UI layer (screens, widgets, BLoC/Cubit)
```

#### Dependency Rules
- Dependencies point inward (presentation → domain ← data)
- Domain layer is independent of external frameworks
- Use dependency injection for loose coupling
- Repository pattern for data access abstraction

### React Native Clean Architecture

#### Recommended Structure
```
src/
├── components/        # Reusable UI components
├── screens/          # Screen components
├── navigation/       # Navigation configuration
├── services/         # API and external services
├── hooks/           # Custom React hooks
├── types/           # TypeScript type definitions
├── store/           # State management (Redux/Zustand)
└── utils/           # Utility functions
```

## Development Guidelines

### Flutter Development Rules

#### Code Organization
- Follow feature-based organization
- Use barrel exports for clean imports
- Implement proper error handling
- Use const constructors where possible

#### State Management Integration
- Always use BaseCubitMixin for Cubits (when available)
- Implement proper loading and error states
- Use Either pattern for error handling
- Register services with dependency injection

#### UI Development
- Create reusable widget components
- Use theme-based styling
- Implement proper localization
- Follow material design guidelines

### React Native Development Rules

#### TypeScript Best Practices
- Use strict TypeScript configuration
- Define proper prop interfaces
- Implement proper error boundaries
