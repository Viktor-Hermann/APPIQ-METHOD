# Create Flutter Story Task

## Overview
This task creates a detailed Flutter development story following Clean Architecture principles with feature-based organization. The story will include all three layers (data/domain/presentation) and comprehensive testing requirements.

## Prerequisites
- Flutter PRD document available
- Flutter architecture document (if applicable)
- Feature requirements clearly defined
- UI/UX specifications available

## Task Execution

### Step 1: Gather Requirements
**Action:** Collect and analyze story requirements
**Process:**
1. Read Flutter PRD or feature requirements
2. Review UI/UX specifications if available
3. Understand user needs and business value
4. Identify technical constraints and dependencies
5. Determine story scope and complexity

**Deliverable:** Clear understanding of feature requirements

### Step 2: Define User Story
**Action:** Create user story following standard format
**Process:**
1. Identify the user persona and role
2. Define the specific functionality/goal
3. Articulate the business value/benefit
4. Add mobile-specific context and usage scenarios
5. Consider offline/online behavior requirements

**Template:**
```
As a [type of user]
I want [goal/functionality]
So that [benefit/value]

Mobile Context:
- Device usage scenario
- User interaction patterns
- Performance expectations
```

### Step 3: Create Acceptance Criteria
**Action:** Define comprehensive, testable acceptance criteria
**Process:**
1. **Functional Criteria:** Define what the feature must do
2. **UI/UX Criteria:** Material Design 3, responsive design, accessibility
3. **Technical Criteria:** Clean Architecture, state management, error handling
4. **Performance Criteria:** Loading times, animations, memory usage

**Quality Check:** Each criterion must be:
- Specific and measurable
- Testable with clear pass/fail conditions
- Aligned with user value and business goals

### Step 4: Break Down Flutter Implementation Tasks
**Action:** Organize tasks by Flutter Clean Architecture layers
**Process:**

#### A. Presentation Layer Tasks
1. **UI Implementation:**
   - Create feature pages/screens with Material 3 design
   - Implement custom widgets and components  
   - Set up responsive layouts for phone/tablet
   - Add animations and micro-interactions
   - Implement accessibility features

2. **State Management (Cubit):**
   - Create Cubit class with business logic coordination
   - Define State classes with Equatable
   - Implement state transitions and error handling
   - Connect UI to Cubit with BlocBuilder/BlocListener

3. **Navigation & Routing:**
   - Define routes and navigation paths
   - Implement deep linking (if required)
   - Add navigation transitions

#### B. Domain Layer Tasks
1. **Business Entities:**
   - Create entity classes with Equatable
   - Define entity relationships and properties
   - Add entity validation rules

2. **Use Cases:**
   - Implement use case classes with @injectable
   - Add business logic and validation
   - Define Either<Failure, Success> return types

3. **Repository Interfaces:**
   - Define repository abstract classes
   - Specify method signatures and return types

#### C. Data Layer Tasks
1. **Data Models:**
   - Create model classes with @freezed annotation
   - Add JSON serialization
   - Implement model to entity conversion methods

2. **Repository Implementations:**
   - Implement concrete repository classes
   - Add error handling and data transformation

3. **Data Sources:**
   - Create remote data source for API calls
   - Implement local data source for caching
   - Add offline-first functionality (if required)

#### D. Cross-Cutting Tasks
1. **Localization & Theming:**
   - Add all text content to ARB files
   - Implement RTL support
   - Verify dark/light theme compatibility

2. **Testing:**
   - Unit tests for domain layer
   - Unit tests for data layer
   - Widget tests for UI components
   - Cubit/state management tests
   - Integration tests for user flows

### Step 5: Add Technical Implementation Details
**Action:** Provide technical guidance for developers
**Process:**
1. List required Flutter dependencies
2. Define file structure following feature-based architecture
3. Specify key implementation patterns
4. Include performance considerations
5. Add security requirements (if applicable)

### Step 6: Define Testing Requirements
**Action:** Create comprehensive testing strategy
**Process:**
1. **Unit Tests:** Domain and data layer testing with mocks
2. **Widget Tests:** UI component testing in isolation
3. **Cubit Tests:** State management testing with bloc_test
4. **Integration Tests:** End-to-end user flow testing
5. **Accessibility Tests:** Screen reader and semantic testing

**Coverage Target:** Minimum 80% code coverage, 100% for business logic

### Step 7: Add Development Notes
**Action:** Include additional guidance and considerations
**Process:**
1. Performance optimization tips
2. Accessibility implementation guidelines
3. Localization best practices
4. Code quality standards
5. Common pitfalls and solutions

### Step 8: Create Definition of Done
**Action:** Define clear completion criteria
**Process:**
1. **Implementation Complete:** All tasks and layers implemented
2. **Code Quality:** Follows Flutter best practices and standards
3. **Testing Complete:** All tests written and passing
4. **Performance Verified:** Meets performance benchmarks
5. **Documentation:** Code documented and file list updated
6. **Review Process:** Code review, design review, QA testing completed

## Template Usage
**Template:** Use `flutter-story-tmpl.yaml` for consistent story structure

## Quality Validation
Before marking story as complete, verify:
- [ ] Story follows standard user story format
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are specific and testable
- [ ] Tasks cover all Flutter architecture layers
- [ ] Technical details provide clear implementation guidance  
- [ ] Testing requirements are comprehensive
- [ ] Performance and accessibility requirements included
- [ ] Localization requirements specified
- [ ] Definition of done is complete and measurable

## Handoff Process
1. Review story with Product Owner for business value alignment
2. Review with Tech Lead for technical feasibility
3. Estimate story points with development team
4. Ensure all dependencies are identified and available
5. Confirm story is ready for development sprint

## Success Criteria
- Story provides complete implementation guidance for developers
- All acceptance criteria are testable and measurable
- Technical approach follows Flutter Clean Architecture principles
- Story scope is appropriate for single sprint completion
- Dependencies and integration points are clearly identified

## Notes
- Keep stories focused on single feature or user flow
- Ensure story can be completed within one sprint (usually 1-2 weeks)
- Consider breaking large features into multiple stories
- Always include mobile-specific considerations (performance, battery, offline)
- Maintain consistency with existing codebase patterns and standards
