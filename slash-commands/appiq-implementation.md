# APPIQ Command Implementation Logic

This document provides the technical implementation details for the `/appiq` slash command interactive system.

## Implementation Flow

### Phase 1: Initial Greeting and Project Type Selection

```
üöÄ Welcome to APPIQ Method Mobile Development!

What type of mobile project are you working on?

1. Greenfield - New mobile app development (Flutter or React Native)
2. Brownfield - Enhancing existing mobile app

Please respond with 1 or 2:
```

**Expected Responses:** `1` or `2`
**Error Handling:** If invalid response, re-prompt with valid options

### Phase 2: Platform Selection (Greenfield Only)

**Trigger:** Only if user selected `1` (Greenfield)

```
üì± Platform Selection for New Mobile App:

Which mobile platform do you want to target?

1. Flutter - Cross-platform with Dart
2. React Native - Cross-platform with React/JavaScript  
3. Let APPIQ Method recommend based on requirements

Please respond with 1, 2, or 3:
```

**Expected Responses:** `1`, `2`, or `3`
**Logic:**
- `1` ‚Üí Flutter workflows
- `2` ‚Üí React Native workflows  
- `3` ‚Üí Platform recommendation prompt ‚Üí then selection

### Phase 3: Existing App Platform Detection (Brownfield Only)

**Trigger:** Only if user selected `2` (Brownfield)

```
üì± Existing Mobile App Platform Detection:

What platform is your existing mobile app built with?

1. Flutter - Dart-based cross-platform app
2. React Native - React/JavaScript-based app
3. Not sure - Let APPIQ Method analyze the codebase

Please respond with 1, 2, or 3:
```

**Expected Responses:** `1`, `2`, or `3`
**Logic:**
- `1` ‚Üí Flutter brownfield workflow
- `2` ‚Üí React Native brownfield workflow
- `3` ‚Üí Codebase analysis ‚Üí platform detection ‚Üí appropriate workflow

### Phase 4: PRD Validation

```
üìã Checking for main_prd.md in your /docs/ folder...

Do you have a main_prd.md file in your /docs/ folder?
(You should create this manually and place it there before proceeding)

Please respond with yes or no:
```

**Expected Responses:** `yes` or `no`
**Logic:**
- `yes` ‚Üí Continue to workflow launch
- `no` ‚Üí Provide guidance for creating main_prd.md, then wait for confirmation

### Phase 5: Workflow Selection and Launch

Based on collected information, select appropriate workflow:

**Greenfield Workflows:**
- Greenfield + Flutter ‚Üí `mobile-greenfield-flutter.yaml`
- Greenfield + React Native ‚Üí `mobile-greenfield-react-native.yaml`

**Brownfield Workflows:**
- Brownfield + Flutter ‚Üí `mobile-brownfield-flutter.yaml`
- Brownfield + React Native ‚Üí `mobile-brownfield-react-native.yaml`

## Workflow Launch Messages

3. Flutter platform validation
4. Mobile UX design system
5. Flutter architecture planning
6. Mobile security review
7. Story creation and development

@analyst - Please begin with creating a mobile-focused project brief considering app store landscape, device capabilities, and mobile user behavior.
```

### Greenfield React Native Launch
```
‚úÖ Perfect! Launching Greenfield React Native Mobile Development Workflow...

üéØ Starting with: mobile-greenfield-react-native.yaml

```

### Brownfield Flutter Launch
```
‚úÖ Perfect! Launching Brownfield Flutter Mobile Enhancement Workflow...

üéØ Starting with: mobile-brownfield-flutter.yaml

2. Existing Flutter app analysis
3. Mobile PRD creation for enhancements
4. Flutter architecture updates (if needed)
5. Mobile security review
6. Story creation and development

@analyst - Please classify the mobile enhancement scope. Can you describe the Flutter app enhancement? Is this a small fix, a feature addition, or a major enhancement requiring architectural changes?
```

### Brownfield React Native Launch
```
‚úÖ Perfect! Launching Brownfield React Native Mobile Enhancement Workflow...

üéØ Starting with: mobile-brownfield-react-native.yaml
üìç First Agent: analyst (classifying mobile enhancement scope)
üìÇ Expected Analysis: React Native app analysis and enhancement classification

The mobile enhancement workflow will now guide you through:
1. Enhancement scope classification
2. Existing React Native app analysis
3. Mobile PRD creation for enhancements

## Error States and Recovery

### Missing main_prd.md
```
‚ùå main_prd.md not found in /docs/ folder.

Please create your main Product Requirements Document first:

1. Create a /docs/ folder in your project root
2. Create a main_prd.md file with your project requirements
3. Place it at: /docs/main_prd.md
4. Run /appiq again

Would you like guidance on creating a main_prd.md file? (yes/no)
```

### Invalid Response
```
‚ùå Invalid response. Please respond with one of the specified options.

[Re-display current question]
```

### Platform Recommendation (Option 3)
```
ü§î Let APPIQ Method recommend the best platform for your project.

Based on your requirements in main_prd.md, please answer these questions:

1. Do you have an existing React/JavaScript web application? (yes/no)
2. Do you need maximum performance for graphics/animations? (yes/no)
3. Do you have existing React/JavaScript team expertise? (yes/no)
4. Do you need extensive native platform integrations? (yes/no)

[Collect responses and provide recommendation]

üìä Recommendation: [Flutter/React Native] based on your answers
Reasoning: [Specific reasoning based on responses]

Do you want to proceed with [recommended platform]? (yes/no)
```

## Integration Points

### With Existing Workflows
- Seamlessly integrates with existing APPIQ Method workflow system
- Uses established agent orchestration patterns
- Leverages existing templates and checklists

### With IDEs
- Claude: Native slash command support
- Cursor: Can be triggered via command palette or chat
- Windsurf: Integration via chat interface
- Other IDEs: Universal chat-based implementation

### With File System
- Automatically checks for /docs/ folder structure
- Validates main_prd.md existence
- Sets up expected file outputs for workflow

## State Management

The command maintains state through the interactive session:

1. **Project Type**: Greenfield or Brownfield
2. **Platform Choice**: Flutter, React Native, or Recommendation needed
3. **PRD Status**: Exists or needs creation
4. **Workflow Selection**: Final workflow to execute

This state is used to determine the exact workflow launch and initial agent prompt.

## Extensibility

The implementation is designed to be extensible for:
- Additional mobile platforms (native iOS/Android)
- Integration with other APPIQ Method expansion packs
- Custom workflow variations
- IDE-specific optimizations
